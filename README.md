# Project Cloner

Duplicate a GitHub project and its content. You get a repo with the same name, description, content and issue as the original. All the issuses are added to a new project and the custome fields are copied over.

Create a .env file using the .env.sample file as a template.

Run `npm install` and then `npm run start`.
